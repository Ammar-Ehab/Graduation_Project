# Graduation_Project
The graduation project focused on the development of a conversational AI platform aimed at providing a smart system to automate services for multiple service providers. The goal is to save valuable time, money, and manpower for these providers while offering users 24-hour assistance. The project addresses the addictive nature of social media and the increasing popularity of conversational AI, as well as the preference of individuals for human interaction.

The system design and implementation phase involved the use of tools such as Flutter, Rasa, and Firebase. Flutter, an open-source mobile app development framework, was utilized to create a cross-platform mobile application for Android and iOS. Rasa, an open-source framework, was employed to build the chatbot component of the system. Firebase, a suite of backend services, provided the necessary infrastructure. By leveraging our Arabic chatbot, we aimed to automate their services and enhance user experiences. This design allowed for user-friendly and intuitive interactions with the chatbot.
